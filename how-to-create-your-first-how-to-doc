# How to create your first how-to document!
## Introduction
In this document you will learn how to write your first how-to document, from A to Z.
## Prerequisites
In order to complete your first writing test, you will need perform the following actions:
1. Open an Account in [Github](https://github.com/join/) and create your first respository.
2. Download and install [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Download and install a text editor. I chose [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however other good options are [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or even [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
## Steps
### Configure your new Github Account with the following:
* A new repository with a name which reflects its purpose - for instance "My Public Tech Docs"
* On your local machine, navigate to the directory where you wish to store your Git project files, and run 'git clone' to clone your repository to your local machine.
