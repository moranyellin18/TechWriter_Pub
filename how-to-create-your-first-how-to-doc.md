# How to create your first how-to document!
## Introduction
### In this document you will learn how to write your first how-to document, with detailed steps from A to Z.
## Prerequisites
### In order to complete your first writing task, please perform the following actions:
1. Create an Account in [Github](https://github.com/join/) and create your first respository.
2. Download and install [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Download and install a text editor. I chose [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however other good options are [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or even [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
## Steps
### Configure your new Github Account with the following:
* A new repository with a name which reflects its purpose - for instance "My Public Tech Docs"
* On your local machine, navigate to the directory where you wish to store your Git project files, and run 'git clone' to clone your repository to your local machine.

* Rename your file with a descriptive name.
### Start writing your document!
Include as many formatting elements as possible - such as headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, code snippets, links, images, and other formatting elements using Markdown syntax.
### Save the file, commit and push changes to your Git Repository
* Save the file in Visual Studio Code with a 'Markdown' type:

* Before commiting and pushing the changes to Github, make sure to set your account's default identity:

* Execute 'git add .' command

## Troubleshooting
### Please find below a list of common issues you may encounter while pefroming the above steups, and their possible solutions:
* "fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git" --> make sure to browse correctly into your Git repository location
* "Author identity unknown" --> make sure to set your account's default identity, as described in the previous section.
## Conclusion
Tech writing is fun! You should do it more often ðŸ˜Š
